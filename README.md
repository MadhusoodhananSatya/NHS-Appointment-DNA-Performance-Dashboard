üåü NHS Appointment DNA Dashboard
================================

This project was developed as part of my important work analyzing **NHS appointment attendance data** to understand and address **Did Not Attend (DNA)** rates. Using **Excel for initial exploration, SQL for data cleaning and aggregation, and Power BI for dashboard development**, I built an end-to-end workflow that highlights the operational and financial impact of missed appointments.

The primary aim was to deliver actionable insights for NHS stakeholders to help **reduce no-shows, optimize resources, and improve patient care delivery**.

‚ú® **Key Features & Technical Details**

-   **Data Exploration (Excel):**

    -   Conducted exploratory analysis using pivot tables and summary statistics.

    -   Identified data inconsistencies, missing values, and validated appointment categories.

-   **Data Cleaning & Aggregation (SQL):**

    -   Standardized appointment status, modes, and supplier records.

    -   Calculated key metrics including DNA counts, DNA rates, and financial costs.

    -   Aggregated results by region and Primary Care Networks (PCNs).

-   **Dashboard Development (Power BI):**

    -   **KPIs Displayed:**

        -   Total Appointments: **94M**

        -   DNA Count: **4M**

        -   DNA Rate: **0.04%**

        -   DNA Cost: **¬£115M**

    -   **Appointment Mode Analysis:** Breakdown by Face-to-Face, Telephone, Home Visit, and Video Conference.

    -   **Geographic Insights:** DNA rates mapped across UK regions.

    -   **Status Breakdown:** Attended, DNA, and Unknown categories.

    -   **Time Trends:** Monthly trends for appointment volumes and DNA rates.

    -   **PCN-Level Analysis:** Drill-down to individual Primary Care Network performance.

    -   **Interactive Filters:** Month, Mode, Status, Supplier, with a reset option for user-friendly navigation.

üöÄ **Getting Started**

To replicate this project, you will need:

-   **Excel** (for initial exploration).

-   **SQL Server** (or any SQL-compatible environment for cleaning and aggregation).

-   **Power BI Desktop** (for building the dashboard).

Steps:

1.  Load NHS appointment datasets into Excel and carry out initial checks.

2.  Use SQL queries to clean and aggregate appointment data.

3.  Import the processed dataset into Power BI.

4.  Create visuals and KPIs to replicate the interactive dashboard.

üìä **Project Workflow**

1.  **Excel Exploration:**

    -   Reviewed and summarized DNA trends with pivot tables.

    -   Identified anomalies and prepared data for SQL analysis.

2.  **SQL Processing:**

    -   Cleaned and standardized datasets.

    -   Computed KPIs including DNA counts, rates, and financial impacts.

3.  **Dashboard Design in Power BI:**

    -   Created KPIs, maps, bar charts, line graphs, and donut charts.

    -   Implemented slicers and filters for user-driven exploration.

4.  **Key Insights:**

    -   Face-to-face appointments had the **highest DNA rates**.

    -   Some UK regions showed **significantly higher DNA volumes**.

    -   Missed appointments cost approximately **¬£115M**.

    -   Monthly trends revealed fluctuating appointment volumes but relatively stable DNA rates.

üìà **Final Thoughts**

This project demonstrates the value of combining **Excel, SQL, and Power BI** to analyze healthcare datasets at scale. The insights delivered through the dashboard provided NHS stakeholders with an evidence-based foundation to target interventions, reduce no-shows, and improve overall service efficiency.
